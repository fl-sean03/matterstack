**Focus:** Release Polish, Usability, and Cleanup

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This document reports the successful completion of the **MatterStack v0.2.3 "Polish" Sprint**. Following the major architectural delivery of v0.2.2, this release focused on preparing the codebase for public consumption by clarifying the API surface, establishing versioning history, and dramatically improving the onboarding experience.

The system now has a documented history, a clean import interface, and a "5-minute zero-to-evidence" quickstart path.

## 2. Implementation Detail

### Thrust 1: Versioning & Changelog
**Goal:** Establish clear release history.

*   **Versioning**: Bumped version to `0.2.3` in `pyproject.toml` and `matterstack/__init__.py`.
*   **History**: Created `CHANGELOG.md` documenting the evolution from v0.2.0 (Run-Centric Rewrite) through v0.2.1 (Hardening) and v0.2.2 (Production Lifecycle) to v0.2.3.

### Thrust 2: Public API Cleanup
**Goal:** Define a clean interface for library users.

*   **Exports**: Updated `__init__.py` files to explicitly export core components (`Campaign`, `Task`, `RunHandle`, `initialize_run`, etc.) using `__all__`.
*   **Result**: Users can now do `from matterstack import Campaign, Task` instead of digging into submodules.
*   **Verification**: A script validated that all core symbols are importable from the top level.

### Thrust 3: Quickstart & Smoke Test
**Goal:** Improve the "Day 1" experience.

*   **Self-Test**: Implemented `matterstack self-test` in the CLI. This command runs a hidden, zero-config campaign that creates a temporary run, executes a task, and exports evidence, verifying the entire stack in seconds.
*   **Documentation**: Rewrote `README.md` with a "5-Minute Quickstart" guide that walks users through installation, self-testing, and running their first real campaign.

## 3. Conclusion

MatterStack v0.2.3 is a polished, user-friendly release that wraps the powerful capabilities of v0.2.2 in a package that is easy to install, verify, and use.
